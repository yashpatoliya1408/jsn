                    Swaminarayan was born on 3 April 1781 (Chaitra Sud 9, Samvat 1837) in Chhapaiya, a village near
                    Ayodhya in present-day Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.[1] Born into the Brahmin or priestly caste of
                    Sarvariya, Swaminarayan was named Ghanshyam Pande by his parents, Hariprasad Pande (father, also
                    known as Dharmadev) and Premvati Pande (mother, also known as Bhaktimata and Murtidevi).[1] The
                    birth of Swaminarayan coincided with the Hindu festival of Rama Navami, celebrating the birth of
                    Rama. The ninth lunar day in the fortnight of the waxing moon in the month of Chaitra (Marchâ€“April),
                    is celebrated as both Rama Navami and Swaminarayan Jayanti by Swaminarayan followers. This
                    celebration also marks the beginning of a ritual calendar for the followers.[21]

                    A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair, was cursed by sage
                    Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.[22]

                    Swaminarayan had an elder brother, Rampratap Pande, and a younger brother, Ichcharam Pande.[23] He
                    is said to have mastered the scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, the
                    Ramayana, and the Mahabharata by the age of seven.[24]....

                    After the death of his parents, Ghanshyam Pande left his home on 29 June 1792 (Ashadh Sud 10, Samvat
                    1849) at the age of 11.[25] He took the name Nilkanth Varni while on his journey. Nilkanth Varni
                    travelled across India and parts of Nepal in search of an ashram, or hermitage, that practiced what
                    he considered a correct understanding of Vedanta, Samkhya, Yoga, and Pancaratra.[26] To find such an
                    ashram, Nilkanth Varni asked the following five questions on the basic Vaishnava Vedanta
                    categories:[27]

                    What is Jiva?
                    What is Ishvara?
                    What is Maya?
                    What is Brahman?
                    What is Parabrahman?
                    While on his journey, Nilkanth Varni mastered Astanga yoga (eightfold yoga) in a span of nine months
                    under the guidance of an aged yogic master named Gopal Yogi.[28] In Nepal, it is said that he met
                    King Rana Bahadur Shah and cured him of his stomach illness. As a result, the king freed all the
                    ascetics he had imprisoned.[29] Nilkanth Varni visited the Jagannath Temple in Puri as well as
                    temples in Badrinath, Rameswaram, Nashik, Dwarka, and Pandharpur.[25]

                    In 1799, after a seven-year journey, Nilkanth's travels as a yogi eventually concluded in Loj, a
                    village in the Junagadh district of Gujarat. In Loj, Nilkanth Varni met Muktanand Swami, a senior
                    disciple of Ramanand Swami. Muktanand Swami, who was 22 years older than Nilkanth, answered the five
                    questions to Nilkanth's satisfaction.[30] Nilkanth decided to stay for the opportunity to meet
                    Ramanand Swami, whom he met a few months after his arrival in Gujarat.[31] He later claimed in the
                    Vachnamrut that during this period, he took up a severe penance to eliminate his mother's flesh and
                    blood from his body so that the sign of his physical attachment to family, was completely
                    removed....

                    According to the sect, Nilkanth's understanding of the metaphysical and epistemological concepts of
                    the pancha-tattvas (five eternal elements), together with his mental and physical discipline,
                    inspired senior swamis of Ramanand Swami.[32]

                    Nilkanth Varni received sannyasa initiation from Ramanand Swami on 20 October 1800, and with it was
                    granted the names Sahajanand Swami and Narayan Muni to signify his new status.[33]

                    At the age of 21, Sahajanand Swami was appointed successor to Ramanand Swami as the leader of the
                    Uddhava Sampradaya[33] by Ramanand Swami, prior to his death. The Uddhava Sampradaya henceforth came
                    to be known as the Swaminarayan Sampradaya.[34] According to sources he proclaimed the worship of
                    one sole deity, Krishna or Narayana.[35] Krishna was considered by him his own ishtadevata. In
                    contrast with the Vaishnava sect known as the Radha-vallabha Sampradaya,[36] he had a more
                    puritanical approach, rather than the theological views of Krishna that are strongly capricious in
                    character and imagery. While being a worshipper of Krishna, Swaminarayan rejected licentious
                    elements in Krishnology in favor of worship in the mood of majesty, alike to earlier Vaishnava
                    teachers, Ramanuja and Yamunacharya.[37]....

                    In the Vachanamrit (Vadtal 18), Shreeji Maharaj explains the importance of and knowing ones Guru
                    Parampara (lineage). For, if one is asked about the same, a response is immediately given.

                    Shree Ramanand Swami was Uddhav incarnate. He received Vaishnavi Diksha from Shree Ramanuj Acharya,
                    personally whilst in a dream-state. So Ramanuj Acharya is Ramanand Swamis Guru. Shreeji Maharaj is
                    that Ramanand Swamis disciple and successor.

                    In Vadtal, on Prabodhini Ekadashi of Vikram Samvat 1882, after due deliberation Shreeji Maharaj
                    adopted His nephews Ayodhyaprasadji Pande and Raghuveerji Pande as His sons. Establishing the two
                    Gadis i.e. NarNarayan Dev Gadi at Ahmedabad and LaxmiNarayan Dev Gadi at Vadtal, Shreeji Maharaj
                    instructed the two brothers to draw lots, to decide who would be seated on which Gadi. Shreeji
                    Maharaj then instructed all the followers present to do poojan of their respective Acharyas.
                    Ayodhyaprasadji Maharaj was appointed the inaugural Acharya of the NarNarayan Dev Gadi (also known
                    as the Uttar Vibhag - Northern division), whilst Raghuveerji Maharaj became the inaugural Acharya of
                    the LaxmiNarayan Dev Gadi also known as the Dakshin Vibhag - Southern division....
